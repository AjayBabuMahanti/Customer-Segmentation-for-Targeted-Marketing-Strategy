# **Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Strategy**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
In todayâ€™s competitive market, businesses often spend excessively on generalized marketing campaigns that fail to deliver optimal results. Without a clear understanding of customer behavior, companies miss opportunities to personalize offerings, retain valuable customers, and optimize marketing budgets.

This project uses **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **clustering techniques** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. These segments enable businesses to:
- Identify **high-value customers**
- Recognize **at-risk and dormant customers**
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Boost **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
----

## **ðŸ›  Problem Statement**
Currently, all customers are treated the same, regardless of their purchasing patterns. This lack of segmentation results in:
- Higher customer churn
- Low engagement rates
- Missed revenue opportunities

By applying **data-driven segmentation**, we can uncover actionable customer groups and implement tailored marketing strategies to improve retention and revenue.
----

## **ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives**
- Segment customers using **RFM analysis**
- Apply clustering techniques (K-Means) to identify customer groups
- Answer key business questions:
  1. Who are the most valuable customers?
  2. Which customers are most likely to churn?
  3. Are there clear behavioral segments in the customer base?
  4. How can marketing be personalized for each segment?
  5. What strategies can re-engage inactive customers?

## **ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview**
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

**Description:**
This dataset contains over **500,000 transactions** from a UK-based online retail store between December 2010 and December 2011.

**Key Features:**
- `InvoiceNo`: Unique ID for each transaction
- `StockCode`: Product/item code
- `Description`: Product name
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of transaction
- `UnitPrice`: Price per item
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
- `Country`: Country of the customer
----

## **ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove cancellations & invalid records
   - Convert date fields to proper formats

2. **RFM Analysis**
   - Calculate **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** scores for each customer
   - Standardize and normalize RFM values

3. **Clustering (K-Means)**
   - Determine optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score)
   - Apply K-Means clustering
   - Assign customers to segments

4. **Segment Analysis**
   - Profile each segment
   - Identify behavioral traits

5. **Business Recommendations**
   - Tailored marketing strategies for each customer group

6. **Visualization & Dashboard**
   - Power BI / Tableau for interactive insights

## **ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcome**
The final segmentation will group customers into categories like:
- **High-Value Loyal Customers**
- **Occasional Shoppers**
- **Discount-Driven Buyers**
- **At-Risk Customers**
- **Dormant Customers**

Each group will have **specific data-driven marketing recommendations** to improve engagement, retention, and revenue.
