Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Strategy

---

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In todayâ€™s competitive market, businesses often spend excessively on generalized marketing campaigns that fail to deliver optimal results. Without a clear understanding of customer behavior, companies miss opportunities to personalize offerings, retain valuable customers, and optimize marketing budgets.

This project uses RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. These segments enable businesses to:

Identify high-value customers

Recognize at-risk and dormant customers

Personalize marketing campaigns

Boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

---

ðŸ›  Problem Statement
Currently, all customers are treated the same, regardless of their purchasing patterns. This lack of segmentation results in:

Higher customer churn

Low engagement rates

Missed revenue opportunities

By applying data-driven segmentation, we can uncover actionable customer groups and implement tailored marketing strategies to improve retention and revenue.

---

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
Segment customers using RFM analysis

Apply clustering techniques (K-Means) to identify customer groups

Answer key business questions:

Who are the most valuable customers?

Which customers are most likely to churn?

Are there clear behavioral segments in the customer base?

How can marketing be personalized for each segment?

What strategies can re-engage inactive customers?
